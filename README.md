# GBJAM8 (The Binding of Isaac: Game Boy Edition)

A demake for the *classic roguelike* **The Binding of Isaac** originally developed by
**Edmund McMillen** and **Florian Hims**. This homebrew redesign of the game was built
from the ground up to run on the orignal **Game Boy** hardware itself (meaning it will
require an emulator to play on the PC).

The project was made for 2020's **[#GBJAM8](https://itch.io/jam/gbjam-8)** and is more
of a prototype as to what the game would be like running on original **Game Boy**
hardware so, many features may be missing or lacking polish. Hopefully, in the future,
this project could be fleshed out more into a well-rounded and enjoyable experience.

You can find a download for the game's ROM file over on
