DESCRIPTION:
------------
You can use the Gameboy Tile Designer ("GBTD") to design tiles for your own
Gameboy productions.


DISCLAIMER:
-----------
The Gameboy Tile Designer is Freeware; you are allowed to use it in any way 
you want, without paying me anything. The only thing I want in return are 
bug-reports and enhancement-requests, which can be mailed to 
hpmulder@casema.net.

You are also allowed (and encouraged) to distribute this software, as long
as you don't receive any payment for it. If you want to link your home page
to GBTD, be sure to link it to the main site, not directly to the file, as 
updates will receive different filenames.

Keep in mind that you use this software at your own risk; any damage which 
might occur, in whatever form, is your own responsibility.


TO INSTALL:
-----------
  Start GBTD.EXE (That's generally it).

  For maximum enjoyment, make sure all accompanied files are in the same
  directory as GBTD.EXE. Also, associate .GBR-files to GBTD; next to loading
  GBTD when you select a .GBR-file, GBTD will also start adding these files
  to your Documents-menu when this association exists. Adding GBTD.EXE to
  your start-bar or desktop might also simplify things.


CONTACT INFO:
-------------
  You can get the latest version and info about GBTD from www-site:
